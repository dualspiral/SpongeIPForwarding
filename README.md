This plugin for BungeeCord allows those who run modded Sponge networks to run IP forwarding with their forge mods.

###How to use
Install the plugin (found on the releases page) into the BungeeCord plugin folder. Make sure the Bungee and Sponge servers
have IP Forwarding turned on.

That's it. No plugin configuration. Everything will just work.

###Compiling
Because "bungeecord-proxy" doesn't seem to be on the Sonatype OSS repo, you need to download that yourself, or find a repo
that does use it.

###Licence
MIT.
